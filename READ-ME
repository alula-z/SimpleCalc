# SimpleCalc

A basic calculator app built with SwiftUI as part of my iOS development learning journey.

## Overview

SimpleCalc is a straightforward calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project helped me understand SwiftUI fundamentals, state management, and mobile app UI design principles.

## Features

- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- ✅ Clean, intuitive SwiftUI interface
- ✅ Real-time calculation display
- ✅ Clear/reset functionality

## Screenshots

*[Add screenshots of your app here when available]*

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** - For building the user interface
- **Swift** - Primary programming language
- **Xcode** - Development environment

## Current Status

This is a learning project and is currently **in development**. The core functionality works, but there are some known issues I'm working to resolve.

### Known Issues

- Decimal point calculations may produce unexpected results
- Multiple operator presses can cause display errors
- Large number calculations need better formatting
- Edge cases with division by zero handling

### Planned Improvements

- Fix decimal point calculation logic
- Improve error handling for edge cases
- Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Implement calculation history
- Add haptic feedback
- Improve accessibility features

## Learning Outcomes

Through building this calculator, I gained experience with:

- SwiftUI layout system and modifiers
- State management with `@State` property wrappers
- Handling user input and updating UI reactively
- iOS app architecture and design patterns
- Debugging and testing iOS applications

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `SimpleCalc.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device (iOS 14.0+)

## Future Plans

This calculator serves as a foundation for exploring more advanced iOS development concepts. I plan to continue refining it while working on more complex projects.
